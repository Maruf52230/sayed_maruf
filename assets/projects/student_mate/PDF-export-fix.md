# Multi-page PDF Export Fix

## Problem Fixed

The previous version of the Note Maker App was generating PDFs with all content on a single page, which caused several issues:

1. Long notes would be cut off or simply not visible
2. Text flowed off the page boundaries
3. Notes were difficult to read due to poor formatting
4. No page numbers or navigation aids

## Solution Implemented

We have completely redesigned the PDF export functionality to properly handle documents of any length:

### Proper Pagination

- Content is now automatically split across multiple pages
- Each page respects proper margins and content boundaries
- New pages are created as needed when content exceeds a page

### Enhanced Formatting

- Clear document title on the first page
- Page headers on subsequent pages
- Footer with page numbers (e.g., "Page 2 of 7")
- Proper line height and spacing
- Metadata embedded in the PDF document

### Technical Improvements

1. **Page Dimensions Management**:
   - Proper calculation of page width, height, and margins
   - Content width adjusted to prevent overflow

2. **Text Flow Control**:
   - Text properly wraps within page boundaries
   - Line height is consistently maintained
   - Position tracking ensures text stays within margins

3. **Multi-Page Handling**:
   - Automatic page breaks when content exceeds page height
   - Page number tracking and display
   - Headers and footers on all pages

4. **PDF Document Metadata**:
   - Title, author, subject, and keywords
   - Creation date timestamp
   - Document properties properly set

## How to Use

The PDF export process remains the same from a user perspective:

1. Extract text from images/PDFs
2. Generate notes
3. Click "Save as Multi-page PDF"

The resulting PDF will now be a properly formatted document with all content properly displayed across as many pages as needed. This makes it perfect for printing or long-term reference.

## Technical Details

The implementation uses jsPDF's pagination features:

```javascript
// Key new functionality
for (let i = 0; i < textLines.length; i++) {
    // Check if we need to start a new page
    if (yPosition + lineHeight > pageHeight - margin) {
        doc.addPage();
        yPosition = margin + 10; // Reset Y position for new page
        
        // Add page header
        doc.setFontSize(10);
        doc.text(`${title} - Page ${doc.internal.getNumberOfPages()}`, margin, margin);
        doc.setFontSize(11);
    }
    
    // Add the current line of text
    doc.text(textLines[i], margin, yPosition);
    yPosition += lineHeight;
}

// Add page numbers to all pages
const totalPages = doc.internal.getNumberOfPages();
for (let i = 1; i <= totalPages; i++) {
    doc.setPage(i);
    doc.setFontSize(10);
    doc.text(`Page ${i} of ${totalPages}`, margin, pageHeight - 10);
}
```

This ensures that all content is properly displayed, regardless of its length.
