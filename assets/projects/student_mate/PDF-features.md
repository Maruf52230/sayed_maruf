  - Automatic handling of out-of-range pages
  
### 3. PDF Metadata Extraction

- User-friendly error messages

## Usage Guide

1. Click "Select PDFs" to choose multiple PDF files
2. Enter an optional page range in the format described above
   - Leave empty to extract all pages from all PDFs
   - The same range applies to all selected PDFs
3. Click "Extract Text" to begin processing
4. Watch the real-time progress as each PDF and page is processed
5. Once complete, the extracted text will show in the left panel
6. Continue with note generation and PDF export as before

## Technical Details

The PDF processing system now includes:

- **PDF Metadata Reader**: Extracts document information
- **Page Range Parser**: Handles complex page range strings
- **Multi-File Manager**: Coordinates processing of multiple PDFs
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time status
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of problematic files

The implementation uses PDF.js to extract text and maintains backward compatibility with single PDF selection while enabling these new advanced features.
