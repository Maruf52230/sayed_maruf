# Note Maker App - Debugging Information

## Recent Fixes

We've made several improvements to fix the issue with continuous API requests that weren't showing responses:

1. **Token Size Consistency:**
   - Updated text chunking to consistently use 1000 tokens
   - Properly implemented the chunking mechanism

2. **Request Management:**
   - Added an `isProcessing` flag to prevent overlapping requests
   - Added the `apiRequestInProgress` flag to avoid multiple API calls
   - Implemented proper cleanup in finally blocks

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Added comprehensive error handling
   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff for API calls (max 2 retries)
   - Improved error reporting to the user interface

4. **Progress Tracking:**
   - Added visual feedback for chunk processing
   - Added progress indicators for every step
   - Improved status updates during API calls

5. **API Improvements:**
   - Added text size limits (4000 char max) to prevent API overload
   - Better handling of HTML content in the PDF generation
   - Fixed prompt formatting to improve response quality

## How to Verify Fixes

1. Upload a test image or PDF
2. Click "Extract Text" and wait for the extraction to complete
3. Click "Generate Notes" - you should see progress indicators
4. The notes should appear in the right panel when done
5. Click "Save as PDF" to verify the PDF generation

If issues persist, check the browser console for error messages which will be much more detailed now.

## Technical Details

- API requests are now properly throttled and tracked
- Text is chunked in 1000-token segments for better handling
- User interface provides better visibility into the process
- Error recovery mechanisms are in place for API failures
